# Email Pusher

This tool is a simpler version of the important email notifier.  It focuses on listening for emails and only notifying the recipient when the email is from a list of specific users.  The main improvement of this method over email filters is the user experience around setting state to listen and enabling/disabling listening for specific emails.

For example, when a user is busy, they can quickly turn the listener on and toggle specific email addresses that trigger a notification via notifo.
